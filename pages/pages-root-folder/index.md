# About the Modelers and Storytellers Transdisciplinary Training 

In public health, there has been increased interest in using community-engaged approaches to develop “multilevel interventions.”  Evaluating the impact of such interventions is challenging because it is often not feasible to use a randomized controlled trial design. 
Systems science and data science methods have been proposed as an alternative for evaluating such interventions by allowing researchers to investigate the complex causal mechanisms that shape health outcomes and inequities, then simulate the potential impact. Applying these methodologies effectively typically requires researchers trained in diverse disciplines (such as community health, sociology, economics, medicine, biostatistics, and computer science) to integrate their knowledge and skills effectively.
The Modelers and Storytellers Transdisciplinary Training is a two-week virtual summer research education program that will prepare predoctoral and postdoctoral trainees as well as early-career researchers to apply systems and/or data science methods to community-engaged health disparities research. The goal is to accelerate the translation of research into practice to address real-world, complex health issues especially as they relate to health disparities.
 
Students and researchers from diverse disciplines, including but not limited to public health, statistics, computer science, systems engineering, or related fields, who are interested in identifying and addressing health disparities, are encouraged to apply.

Launched in the summer of 2023, the Modelers and Storytellers Transdisciplinary Training will provide 75 trainees over the course of three years (25 per cohort) with the knowledge and skills necessary for applying systems science and data science methods. Additionally, 10 trainees a year interested in gaining more hands-on experience will participate in a one-week practicum experience following the training.
